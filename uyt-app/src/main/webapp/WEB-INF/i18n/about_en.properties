about.description=Cocktails are a declaration of contentment and the love of life, an expression of personal taste and style, a brief respite with or without alcohol, and a carefully prepared or simple mixture of two drinks, whether elaborately decorated or simply served with ice cubes, is always so much more than a drink.<br /><br />This is revealed by the feelings evoked by the word "cocktail" itself. It takes us to an exciting, stylish environment where friends and acquaintances have fun. This word has many positive connotations.
